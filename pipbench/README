To run the server:
python3 server/start_server.py
This starts a PyPi mirror and the PipBench http server which can create pacakges and add them
to the mirror

To create a package:
python3 client/client.py -handler-name <name>
This will create a <name>.tar.gz that can be uploaded to the registry to be used by a worker

TODO the worker will need to call:
pip install --extra-index-url http://localhost:8080/simple/ <package name>
Otherwise we won't actually look in our pip mirror for the packages, and will
instead make a request to PyPi itself
