NOTES:
- The client and server use python3, but the packages and load_simulator shared library are built for python 2.7

Setup:
Run setup.sh to ensure you have the pip packages needed

To run the server:
python3 server/start_server.py
This starts a PyPi mirror and the PipBench http server which can create pacakges and add them
to the mirror

To create a package:
python3 client/client.py -handler-name <name>
This will create a <name>.tar.gz that can be uploaded to the registry to be used by a worker

To install a package
pip2 install --extra-index-url http://localhost:8080/simple/ <package name>

To install from a generated requirements.txt:
pip2 install -r test1/requirements.txt  --index-url http://localhost:9199/simple/
